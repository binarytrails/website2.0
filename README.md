# Personal Website

*Avoiding scripts by implementing CSS stylish functionalities.*

I built it to centralize my realizations and gain web development experience. I challenged myself to only use CSS3 & HTML5 and leave JavaScript aside. It is using the Django Python Web framework to build static web pages. I wanted to gain deep understanding of the trivial web technologies as well as demonstrate that JavaScript is not always necessary for a modern website.

Although I encourage folks to inspire themselves from it, I would appreciate it if you do not copy completely its looks so that it stays a unique representation of my work in which I put numerous hours of mine.
