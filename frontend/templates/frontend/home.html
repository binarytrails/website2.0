					<h4>Developper</h4>
					<p>
						As I am writing this section, I am building my website to elevate my understanding of the web driving technologies.
					</p>
					<p>
						I decided to publish all my projects with an Open Source documented code on 
						<a class="dropdown" href="https://www.github.com/sevaivanov" >GitHub</a> to profit the community.
					</p>
					<p>
						I adore building projects from scratch. I have always had the perseverance to achieve my ambitions.
						There are always after hours of mine that I invest to make my skills sharper. 
						I have built several projects for individual, educational and professional purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am always highly motivated to get aboard a new ship departing into the unknown!

					<h4>Articles</h4>
					<p>
						I have often faced issues that I often have resolved.
						The search for solutions is as fascinating as playing the last Grand Theft Auto video game
							in an Away From the Keyboard world of unlimited possibilities.
						It can get hard, it is true, but the feeling of having succeeded is greater than all of the obstacles.
					</p>
					<p>
						This will be a great place to share the papers of my researches to the world wide web.
						I will present them to you as simple articles with a lightweight presentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Evolving as a human being is accepting to learn from mistakes.
						This having been said, you should not hesitate to write to me to help me understand mine.

					<h4>Short movies</h4>
					<p>
						Back in High School, I started searching different ways to express myself through animated arts.
						I read a lot about Adobe After Effect and I spent a lifetime mastering it.
						I loved taking time after school trying to create something new.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the last High School year, I made my first short film with a friend of mine. I managed to create awesome special effects.
						It was such a great experience! It gave me drive to create video montages freely for the community to encourage its growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						I always love to take some of my time to sit down after work on an inspiration warm evening. 
						I try to let my feelings guide me in the creation of new short movies. 
					</p>

					<h4>Photography</h4>
					<p>
						It started at the same time that my passion for animated arts was making its roots.
						I wasn't very good with Adobe Photoshop and had mastered Adobe After Effect.
					</p>
					<p>
						People always get surprised when learning about my use of AE as an image editing software.
						An advantage of its use is to be able to turn the image editing project to an animated project in a light strike.  
					</p>
					<p>
						After I moved to Linux, I started searching for open source alternatives.
						I found GIMP and I loved it. It lacks a few features but it has a hudge potential in achieving as much as the Adobe suite. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I am using my abilities on a daily life basis to integrate artistic designing into my projects.
