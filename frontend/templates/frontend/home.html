                                Back in Hight School, I started searching different ways to express myself through animated arts.
                                I read a lot about Adobe After Effect and I spend a lifetime mastering it.
                                I loved taking time after school trying to create something new.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the last High School year, I made my first short film that I directed and edited with a friend of mine.
                                It was such a great experience! It drived me to create video montages freely for the community to encourage it growth.

                                On one of those warm inspirational evenings,    
                                I love to take my time to sit down and to let my feelings guide me in a new short project.

                                It started at the same time as my passion to animated arts was making roots.
                                I wasn't very good with Adobe Photoshop and I have mastered Adobe After Effect.

                                People always gets supprised by learning about my use of AE as an image editing software.
                                An advantage of its use is to being able to turn a image editing project to an animated project in light strike.

                                After I moved to Linux, I started seaching open source alternatives.
                                I found GIMP and I loved it. It lacks few features but it has a hudge potential to achieve as much as Adobe suite.
