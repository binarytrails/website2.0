                <h3>
                    Caroline A. Jones, The Mediated Sensorium.
                </h3>

                A sensorium is a combination of auditory, olfactory & tactile experience in which the goal is to alter the senses to create a new sensory envelope of the self.

                It is interesting to imagine that the modern age could derive into individual narcissistic experiences that could bound together to become something we know as the matrix.

                The author questions this by exploring the sensorium elements in relation to contemporary artists who explore new medias, theories and concepts instead of pushing further the exploration of the human body as a physical envelope to enhance its experiences.

                Are we really bound to our bodies? Do we really have control over it? Can we call it a sensory regime if an entity controls what we hear, see, smell, eat and feel or is it just paranoia?

                Jones brings an interesting point on medication, stating that its usage gained bigger proportions over the years. In the past, it targeted only mental illness but as of now it is massively prescribed in everyday life, often starting from childhood to supposedly prevent anxiety, hyperactivity, etc. Indeed, the use of these pills is aimed at trying to help children adapt to our complex modern world. The author then questions the way this could be a sort of implicit control of the population.

                Finally, she writes that the modern capitalism's colonization in relation to aesthetic businesses using sensorium segmentation rules to make profit while controlling the population might only be a coincidence at this point of our history, which is why exploring the new sensorium could be beneficial for the modern age society.
